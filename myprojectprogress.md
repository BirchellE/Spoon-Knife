## Project Selection Progress

As stated in previous labs, I am exploring working on privacy concerns with a client which would search random things on google, and click random ads and links to disguise browsing patterns. I think that large socail media companies abuse the private data given to them, and aren't clear about how they use this data. To research this project, I have been reading articles on AdBlock and other selections that concern companies use of personal data.
